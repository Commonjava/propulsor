# A list of host/port pairs to use for establishing the initial connection to the Kafka cluster. The client
# will make use of all servers irrespective of which servers are specified here for bootstrappingâ€”this list
# only impacts the initial hosts used to discover the full set of servers. This list should be in the form
#
# host1:port1,host2:port2,....
#
# Since these servers are just used for the initial connection to discover the full cluster membership
# (which may change dynamically), this list need not contain the full set of servers (you may want more
# than one, though, in case a server is down).
